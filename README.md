# 🛡️ Information Systems Security and Privacy

This repository contains the exercises and lab materials for the
**Information Systems Security and Privacy** course at the
[Polytechnic University of Bari](https://www.poliba.it).

### 🔎 Contents

Course contents are organized into two primary directories, each targeting a distinct layer
of the modern cybersecurity landscape:

- [`/high_level`](high_level): Focuses on abstract security principles and cryptographic implementations,
  including exercises and conceptual frameworks related to encryption, robust user authentication
  protocols, and the design of access control systems.
- [`/low_level`](low_level): A technical deep dive into systems security and related vulnerabilities.
  The contents prioritize low-level exploitation techniques, including memory corruption
  vulnerabilities such as out-of-bounds reads, integer overflows, and format string exploits.
