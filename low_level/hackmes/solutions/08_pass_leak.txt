1. The program is affected by a format string vulnerability.

The problematic line is:

printf(buf);

Since `buf` is user-controlled, this allows us to read the contents of the stack by providing
a maliciously crafted password that contains format string specifiers. Since the `printf` function
is invoked with no additional arguments, each provided format specifier will cause `printf` to
interpret a slice of stack memory as if it were an argument.

The bug can be fixed by changing the line to: `printf("%s", buf);`

2. Note that the password is located on the heap, so we cannot leak it by only printing the
contents of the stack. The first thing we should do is understand where the `password` pointer
variable is located on the stack. Since it is a pointer, we can input a sequence of %p
specifiers, causing `printf` to print out memory as 8 bytes (64 bits) chunks
formatted as pointers.

As an example, the "%p %p %p %p %p" string will leak 40 bytes of stack memory formatted
as 5 pointers. If one of them is the address of `password`, then we can input a second string
with the corresponding "%p" specifier changed to a "%s". This will direct `printf` to interpret
that memory area as a char pointer, dereference it, and print its contents, leaking the password.

Example (password pointer: 0x13e606090)
---------------------------------------

Password: %p %p %p %p %p
0x102653828 0x16d7aea28 0x13e606090 0x16d7aecb8 0x2 is not the correct password.
> Notice that the third value is the `password` pointer.

Password: %p %p %s
0x100e348d8 0x16efca318 nu4h8cdxutijgo is not the correct password.
> The password is "nu4h8cdxutijgo".

Password: nu4h8cdxutijgo
