1. The program is affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability (may also be considered an off-by-one).

The problematic line is:

user_input("User name", data.buf, sizeof(data.buf) + 1);

The last parameter should instead be `sizeof(data.buf) - 1` (16 bytes - the NULL terminator).
Since the bounds check is off by two, this allows us to overflow the buffer by 1 byte,
writing within the bounds of the `fun` pointer.

2. To call the shellcode function, we need to overwrite the `data.fun` function pointer with
the address of the shellcode function. We are, however, only able to overwrite the least significant
byte (LSB) of the pointer. The compiler will likely place the legitimate `greet` function at
an address that is sufficiently close to that of the `shellcode` function, e.g.:

greet:     0x100f677a8
shellcode: 0x100f6778c

Notice how the addresses only differ for the LSB. This enables us to redirect execution by filling
the buffer and then overwriting a single byte of the `fun` pointer.

Example (greet: 0x100f677a8, shellcode: 0x100f6778c)
