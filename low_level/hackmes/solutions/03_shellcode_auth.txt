1. The program is affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The problematic line is:

user_input("Password", data.buf, sizeof(data));

The last parameter should instead be `sizeof(data.buf) - 1` (16 bytes - the NULL terminator).
Since it is considering the size of the whole `data` struct (32 bytes), this allows us
to overflow the buffer by 16 bytes, writing within the bounds of the `authenticated` flag
and the `error` pointer.

2. To call the shellcode function, we need to overwrite the `data.error` function pointer with
the address of the shellcode function. However, the `data.error` function is only called if
the user is not authenticated, so we must take care to overwrite the `authenticated` flag
with a false value (all zeros). Due to struct padding, the 4 bytes `authenticated` flag will be
followed by 4 bytes of padding, and after that we have the 8 bytes `error` function pointer,
as can be seen from the debug output.

This means a working malicious input must be structured as follows:
[16 arbitrary bytes] [4 zero bytes] [4 arbitrary bytes] [8 bytes shellcode address]

Example (shellcode: 0x104167d08)
--------------------------------
Password: 1234567890123456\00\00\00\00PPPP\08\7d\16\04\01
You got shell!
