1. The program is affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The problematic line is:

user_input("Password", data.buf, sizeof(data));

The last parameter should instead be `sizeof(data.buf) - 1` (16 bytes - the NULL terminator).
Since it is considering the size of the whole `data` struct (20 bytes), this allows us
to overflow the buffer by 4 bytes, writing within the bounds of the `authenticated` flag.

2. Any input that is made of 16 arbitrary characters + 1 or more non-zero characters will work.
The first 16 characters will fill `buf`, while the remaining ones will be written to `authenticated`,
causing it to be evaluated to `true`.
