1. The program is affected by an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to an out-of-bounds read.

The problematic line is:

user_input("Echo", data.buf, sizeof(data.buf));

The last parameter should instead be `sizeof(data.buf) - 1` (16 bytes - the NULL terminator).
Since the bounds check is off by one, this allows us to completely fill the buffer with
non-NULL bytes, including the last one (which should be NULL). This will cause
`printf("%s\n", data.buf)` to print bytes that are outside of the bounds of `buf`.

2. To leak the secret string, we just need to fill the buffer with non-NULL bytes, including
the last one. Since `data.secret` immediately follows `data.buf` in the memory layout of our
program, this will cause `printf("%s\n", data.buf)` to start printing `buf`, and then continue
into `secret`, stopping only when the NULL terminator of `secret` is encountered.
