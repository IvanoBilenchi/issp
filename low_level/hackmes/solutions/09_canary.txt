1. The program is affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The problematic line is:

user_input("Password", data.buf, sizeof(data));

The last parameter should instead be `sizeof(data.buf) - 1` (16 bytes - the NULL terminator).
Since it is considering the size of the whole `data` struct (24 bytes), this allows us to overflow
the buffer by 8 bytes, writing within the bounds of `canary` and `authenticated`.

2. The program contains an application-level implementation of canaries to mitigate buffer overflow
attacks. Consequently, to authenticate as an administrator, we must retrieve the canary value
and construct a payload with the following structure:

[16 arbitrary bytes] [4 bytes canary] [4 bytes (non-zero)]

By leveraging the program's debug logging, we can inspect the data structure's memory layout
to identify the canary. Since the structure terminates with a 4-byte authenticated flag,
the immediately preceding 4 bytes must contain the canary value.

Example (last 8 bytes of data: 22 65 1e 2e 00 00 00 00)
