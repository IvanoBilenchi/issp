1. The program is affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The problematic line is:

user_input("Password", data.buf, sizeof(data));

The last parameter should instead be `sizeof(data.buf) - 1` (16 bytes - the NULL terminator).
Since it is considering the size of the whole `data` struct (32 bytes), this allows us
to overflow the buffer by 16 bytes, writing within the bounds of the `password` field.

2. The instruction that is responsible for the authentication decision is
`strcmp(data.buf, data.password) == 0`. To authenticate as the admin, we just have to
set both `buf` and `password` to the same string, effectively allowing us to "choose"
a password of our liking.

Example
-------
Password: s3cr3tp4ssw0rd\00\00s3cr3tp4ssw0rd
Welcome, admin!
