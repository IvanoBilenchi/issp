1. The program is affected by an integer overflow vulnerability that leads to a buffer overflow.

The problematic lines are:

int len = user_input_int("User name length");
if (len >= BUF_SIZE) { ... }

Since `len` is a signed integer, we can input any negative value which will cause the size
check to pass. The value will then be converted to an unsigned value when passed to the
`user_input` function (which accepts a `size_t` parameter), causing it to underflow to
a very large number. This in turn enables us to overflow the buffer by an arbitrary amount.

The easiest fix is to change `len` to be of type `size_t`: if the user enters a negative value,
it will underflow before the check and be caught by it, ending execution. A better fix would
involve changing the `user_input_int` function to only accept and return unsigned integers.

2. To call the shellcode function, we must first enter a negative value as the length,
and then proceed to overflow the buffer as usual, overwriting the `fun` pointer.

Example (shellcode: 0x104167d08)
--------------------------------
User name length: -1
User name: 1234567890123456\08\7d\16\04\01
You got shell!
