1. The program is affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The problematic line is:

user_input("User name", data.buf, sizeof(data));

The last parameter should instead be `sizeof(data.buf) - 1` (16 bytes - the NULL terminator).
Since it is considering the size of the whole `data` struct (24 bytes), this allows us
to overflow the buffer by 8 bytes, writing within the bounds of the `fun` pointer.

2. To call the shellcode function, we must fill the buffer by providing 16 arbitrary characters,
then input the address of the shellcode function, paying attention to endianness. This
will overwrite the legitimate function pointer, leading to the execution of the shellcode.

Example (shellcode: 0x104167d08)
--------------------------------
User name: 1234567890123456\08\7d\16\04\01
You got shell!
