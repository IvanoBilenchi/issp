# Alice and Bob want to exchange messages over an insecure channel.
# They decide to use HMAC to ensure their authenticity and integrity, but they opt
# to use a 4-digit PIN instead of a randomly generated key so that it is easier to remember.
# Mallory is an attacker who has access to the communication channel between Alice and Bob.
#
# Allow Mallory to obtain the key by brute-forcing the first message,
# and then use it to tamper with the second message.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `generate_bytes` function of the `issp` module to generate possible keys.
# - Assume that Mallory knows that the key is a 4-digit PIN.
